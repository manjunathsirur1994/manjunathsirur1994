### NDVI Forecasting for Agricultural Equipment Lending  
**Hello Tractor | 2024 May ‚Äì 2024 July**  

o	**Project Overview:** 

This project forecasts NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) values to assist a tractor and equipment lending company in gauging vegetation health and expanding their business based on vegetation cover. Utilizing MODIS13Q1 data from Google Earth Engine, the project is implemented in Python with Jupyter notebooks and includes the following components:

o	**Key Responsibilities:**
-	Data Acquisition: Utilizes Google Earth Engine to download MODIS13Q1 raster data.
-	Data Processing: Converts raster data into readable dataframes for further analysis.
-	Modelling: Employs various machine learning, deep learning, and statistical models to forecast NDVI values.
-	Pipeline: An end-to-end pipeline that automates data download, preprocessing, model training, and forecasting.

o	**Technologies Used:** Python, Jupyter Notebooks, Google Earth Engine, Machine Learning, Deep Learning.

o	By providing accurate NDVI predictions, this project enables the company to make informed decisions about lending equipment based on the current and forecasted vegetation cover, optimizing resource allocation and business expansion.


### FinTech Solutions  
**Silicon Valley Bank | 2021-2024**  
Worked on cash forecasting, demand forecasting, 2052a regulatory reporting, and currency forecasting to optimize financial services. Developed intelligent models to enhance financial analysis, fraud detection, and risk management.
